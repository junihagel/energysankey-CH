    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This website is a private, non-commercial website operated from Switzerland. This page explains what data (if any) is collected when you visit this website.
    </p>

    <h2>Website Analytics</h2>

    <p>
      This website uses <strong>TWIPLA</strong> (formerly Visitor Analytics) to collect anonymous usage statistics in order to understand how the website is used and to improve its content.
    </p>

    <p>
      TWIPLA is configured to run in <strong>Maximum Privacy Mode</strong>. In this mode:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>No cookies are used</li>
      <li>No IP addresses are stored</li>
      <li>No device fingerprinting is performed</li>
      <li>No personal or identifiable data is collected</li>
      <li>No data is shared with third parties for advertising purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The collected data is fully anonymous and aggregated and is used solely for statistical purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because no personal data is processed and no cookies are used, no consent banner is required.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Protection</h2>

    <p>
      This website does not collect, store, or process personal data of visitors. No user accounts, contact forms, or tracking profiles are used.
